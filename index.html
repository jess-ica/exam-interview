          The AP computer science principles course explores the fundamentals of computing through a theoretical approach. It teaches computer science from a different approach to many of the other modules, beginning with lessons about the basics of computer hardware, then proceeding to discuss the internet, programming and algorithms. Personally, I had little to no knowledge of many of these concepts beforehand, and I genuinely wish I had. The course provides information that establishes context for the entire area of coding, but even to the average user of technology. I especially enjoyed learning about the ideas of logic gates and circuits, which gave me insight into the fundamental operations of computers, and encryption, which is an interesting concept to me. Generally, this course opened my eyes to a side of computing that I never really learned, and now that I know the basics, I plan to learn more about the concepts in hopes of finding more areas that I can connect and branch my interests towards.

          	Like the name suggests, this course is an introduction to HTML and CSS, for the purpose of creating websites. It discusses the structure of either language, and introduces a variety of HTML tags and CSS properties and selectors. While teaching, the course makes it easy for a beginner to learn, and one thing that stood out to me is that website beauty is not necessarily a priority at first. While this may seem counterintuitive, the act of learning about the pieces of the languages individually made it much easier to later combine and understand them together when I created both the hackathon website and this one. Additionally, this course was my first introduction to web development, as all the languages I learned prior were programming languages (Actionscript, C++, Javascript), while HTML is a markup language and CSS is a style sheet language. Overall, this module taught me a lot about the basics of web development and I hope to expand on this knowledge with the use of libraries and with integration of scripting languages.

          This course builds upon knowledge of basic Javascript, which was learned in Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation. With the goal of creating programs that simulate patterns and behaviours found in nature, the module discusses topics such as randomness, forces and oscillations. Personally, this course challenged me, giving me a lot of practice in the areas of object oriented programming and knowledge of Processing JS functions, and while it was difficult and extremely time consuming, I am happy with the programs created. Additionally, physics is one of my favourite classes, and in this module I saw its concepts applied to a computer simulation, broadening my understanding of both areas. Ultimately, this course helped me during the coding challenge summative, where I applied my knowledge of vectors and angles.

          This module was our summative. In it, we were to choose a live coding challenge by Daniel Shiffman and reproduce it in a manner that would be simple for our classmates to understand and follow along. This was an interesting experience for me because it was the first time that understanding someone else’s code perfectly was critical in achieving my goal. It generally was not that hard after all my practice with understanding code on Khan Academy, but overall served as more practice in this area. The act of learning someone else’s code that accompanied this challenge was influential for me, along with the task of teaching others in the class. It was a final test of my knowledge in the course, and it was a good summarization of everything I learned.

          A library created to simplify DOM modification, jQuery works in tandem with HTML and CSS to enable interaction with a user. While you can accomplish everything you can in jQuery using DOM modification, I personally found the latter to be extremely confusing. Many of the commands were repetitive as well (getElementBy…), which overcomplicated using DOM for anything. Once I moved onto the jQuery course (having understood the concepts of DOM modification), I found it much easier to memorize and internalize the commands and structure of the library. From here on, I have used jQuery to create interactivity in a couple of websites that I have created, including this one and the Hackathon project. Web development interests me, and in the future, when I learn more about it, I will likely use and expand my knowledge of this library.

          The goal of our hackathon was to team up with a few other people and create an app or deliverable in just a couple weeks. We were to use our knowledge from Khan Academy and FreeCodeCamp to do this. My group was successful in doing this and it was a great opportunity for all of us to fine tune our skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript through building a webpage from scratch. For me, it was challenging to work in collaboration with others on a relatively large project, and two of the main things that enabled our success were the use of Github and that of Glitch. Github allowed us to organize our project, keeping track of improvements we could make and bugs that we needed to fix. I will not forget how useful this application was, especially in the future where my projects will be much larger. Glitch was also very helpful, allowing us to edit our website in real time and observe each others’ changes.

          This course teaches the basics of working with Javascript in collaboration with the processing.js library to create small drawings and animations, while introducing the basics of coding. Personally, this course was not difficult for me because the structure of a lot of the Javascript in this course is very similar to that of C++, which I learned last year. The aspects of the processing library taught here were also very simple. This being said, it was nice to review coding before jumping into more complicated Javascript projects for the rest of the course, and the concept of creating an animation by changing the x and y positions of various shapes at a certain frame rate was novel and interesting. Now that I have an understanding of the basics of Javascript, I can incorporate it in other, more complicated Javascript and Processing JS programs and also on webpages.

          While the most popular type of mathematical manipulative is hands down the Rubik’s cube, other, “simpler” versions do exist. In this course I learned two of these: the 2x2 cube and the pyraminx duo. At first glance, these “puzzles” may appear daunting, and without using any strategy to solve them, they may be. What I have learned from my two puzzles is that using a set of “steps” makes the practice of solving one very easy. This set of steps can be called an algorithm, drawing a comparison to algorithms commonly seen in coding. Each (a cube or a program) will start with something and through a series of steps that each has their own goal, end up with an outcome. Additionally, there are several methods to solve a mathematical manipulative, some of which are more efficient. This is the same way with coding. Overall, the practice of cubing was an analogy for coding for me, allowing me to better understand coding and think of it in a different light, one that I may need to refer back to occasionally in the future.

          This module commences by introducing the basics of HTML and CSS, and in the course of 7 submodules, progresses to more advanced material, such as creating a CSS grid. When I started this course, I had already completed the Khan Academy HTML/CSS course, but as it was my time learning the languages, I appreciated this FreeCodeCamp course for reviewing the material. Generally, I found the lessons on FreeCodeCamp to be straightforward, concise, but potent. They cover a lot of material in short sections, and this challenged me and broadened my understanding of the languages. The section about CSS grids has already helped me in my Hackathon group project (to make a calendar), and in the future, I plan on reviewing this material whenever I need to make a new website.

          This course teaches theory (asymptotic notation and runtimes) along with a variety of algorithms such as searches, sorts and graph representation. This course was very difficult for me, especially because at the point in the course where I started learning it I was unfamiliar with Javascript, but persevering through it and learning the various types of algorithms was inspiring. Additionally, this module was beneficial in the sense that I learned a lot about reading and deciphering others’ code. I will continue to approach new algorithms the way I did here. Also, learning about asymptotic notation and runtimes was very interesting to me, and ever since, I have been trying to make sure that my programs are as efficient as possible.
