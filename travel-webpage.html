        <p id = "all-about">
            When  singer songwriter EDEN first started writing music, it was from the comfort of his childhood home in Ireland. While he has now moved on to bigger and better housing, he still writes music in his basement. This popular tourist site holds plenty of amusing experiences for EDEN fans and music lovers alike to experience EDEN's studio up close and personal.

            This guitar lies in a very unexpecting corner of the basement, hiding in between a group of rocks and a dust colony. If you pay close attention, you may realize that this guitar is the very same as the one played in hit track <em>gold</em>. <br><br>

            <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Noguchi_Table.png" alt = "Coffee table" width = "200"> <br>
            This table is the very same one that EDEN eats his meals at every day. While recording his popular songs, he frequently takes breaks to snack here. <br><br>
            
            <li class = "list-items">Dust</li>
            <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Dust-storm-Texas-1935.png" alt = "Dust storm" width = "200"><br>
            This dust is actually found all around EDEN's basement. This being said, it is still quite amazing to observe, as this is the dust that EDEN himself lives around every day
