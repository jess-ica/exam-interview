      Today I read a book. I hadn't read a book in a long time, and this event
      made me realize that I used to love reading and writing. I wonder how my
      life would have been different if I had pursued that goal instead. The
      book wasn't a long one, but it was a good read and it opened my eyes to
      many new and interesting pieces of information.

      Recently I was scrolling through YouTube and I came across an interesting
      page. A man named Danny Gonzalez was shouting aggressively at the camera.
      He even had the audacity to call me "Greg"???? My name is not Greg. I am
      deeply offended by the slanderous accusations made by 'Danny Gonzalez' and
      will be pursuing legal action.

      After being too busy to listen to music for a long time, I finally got
      back into the scene. A promising artist that I came across in my
      recommended playlist was 'EDEN'. I really love how his unique style of
      music, combining the alternate, indie and electronic genres. My favourite
      song of his is named "rock + roll".
